\section*{Abstract}
The subject of this bachelor thesis is decentralized cloud computing platforms. The purpose of the bachelor thesis is to build a global marketplace for computing power using Ethereum and a self implemented reference implementation, Zeppelin, based on a protocol developed for trustless trading with computing power. In recent years, Bitcoin and other crypto based currencies flourished as an alternative to ordinary currencies. Ethereum takes the Bitcoin blockchain a bit further, enabling smart contracts which forces a trustless environment. \\ \newline
The study consists of three main tasks: 
\begin{itemize}
\item General research in the field of decentralized applications.
\item Drafting a protocol enabling trustless trading with computing power and other services.
\item Creating a reference implementation of the protocol using Ethereum, JavaScript and Docker.\newline
\end{itemize}
In order to test Zeppelin in action a small scale test network was needed, thus a network consisting of three Raspberry PIs, called Zeppelins, was used in order to test the Zeppelin reference implementation. 

We have made an attempt. The protocol has not yet been fully implemented. The protocol is abstract.
